# DinnerAndAMovie

DinnerAndAMovie allows you to enter you address and see the movie Theaters
nearby. Then, from the list of theaters, you can select the theater of Your
choice to view nearby restaurants.

I used the yelp API to get the restaurants/theaters.

I used the Django framework, primarily just to handle the form and backend API
call to Yelp.

I am running out of time and have to submit right now but I will update the
README with more info.
